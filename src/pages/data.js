      'As the solo marketer, I took full ownership of the redesign. I restructured the site, rewrote all content in three languages (EN, VI, JP), redesigned visuals in Figma, and rebuilt the site on WordPress. I also created new content hubs like Medical Tourism, Pediatric Eye Care, and Online Consultation to expand reach and showcase services.'

      'The result was a fully modernized, SEO-driven platform that felt warm, trustworthy, and medically professional ‚Äî leading to a 5X increase in traffic, top 10 keyword rankings in four languages, and more doctor appointment form submissions.',
