            Iâ€™m a self-taught English speaker and front-end developer, and a
            full-stack digital marketer with 3 years of hands-on experience.
            Iâ€™ve built multiple websites from scratch using WordPress, managed
            social media platforms, run advertising campaigns, and designed
            marketing materials aligned with brand identities across channels.
          </p>

            My journey hasnâ€™t followed a straight line from high school to
            university to career, like many of my peers â€” or maybe like yours.
            Itâ€™s been a zigzag path full of ups and downs: from self-doubt to
            confidence, from tears to smiles, from factory worker to marketer.
            But through it all, Iâ€™ve stayed consistent and persistent over the
            last 10 years.
