          How Did I Teach Myself Front-End Coding from Zero, Without Formal

                And yes — this is where my front-end coding journey connects to
                my marketing career:

              Every website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, regardless
              of the CMS platform — whether it’s WordPress, Shopify, or anything
              else. Websites are a core part of digital marketing; they’re the
              face of a brand on the internet. Having a solid understanding of
              how websites work at the code level gives me strong website
              management skills — not just as a marketer who updates content,
              but as someone who truly understands the structure, design, and
              technical foundation behind it.

              I used to hate technology — and every line of code — because it
              felt too complicated to handle… and too boring.

              My idol is Huyền Chip. She’s not a singer or an actress — but in
              my heart, she’s someone who thinks and acts without fear of
              judgment or failure. Plus, her background is quite similar to
              mine: she comes from a farming family in the countryside. I’ve
              followed her journey since she published her first solo travel
              book, “Xách ba lô lên và đi,” and became known in Vietnam — all
              the way to the day she got into Stanford University on a full
              scholarship to study computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was in awe. I told myself: Huyền Chip studied computer science
              at Stanford. You studied marketing in college — but why not try to
              learn some coding outside your marketing time? She did it
              successfully. You might not become as successful as her, but who
              knows — maybe you’ll like it, even if you hate it at first.
            </p>
            <p>
              The time between that thought and my first action was less than a
              week. I had no textbook, no instruction, no support, and no
              background knowledge. All I had were pure determination, a strong
              desire to challenge myself by learning something I once hated, and
              a belief that I could figure it out.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s been almost 5 years since then.{' '}
              <strong>
                Now, I can build websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                ReactJS.
              </strong>{' '}
              And the most important thing is: once the journey has started, it
              will never end — not until I master them.
