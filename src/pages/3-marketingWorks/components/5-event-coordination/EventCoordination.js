        <h4>Event Overview:</h4>
        <p>
          The European Eye Center was honored to participate in the Health Fair
          hosted by the U.S. Consulate General â€“ Ho Chi Minh City on January 17,
          2024. Dr. JD Ferwerda delivered an informative speech on Dry Eye
          Syndrome, and we also provided three complimentary eye tests:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vision tests</li>
          <li>Eye pressure tests</li>
          <li>Dry eye tests</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We were pleased and pleasantly surprised by the considerable interest
          and concern shown by attendees in our eye tests. The addition of a
          mini-game added to the enjoyment of the event, making the overall
          experience smooth and delightful.

        <h4>My Roles: </h4>
        <p>
          When the manager notified me that our clinic was invited to join the
          event at The American Center by the U.S. Consulate, I immediately
          conducted a quick meeting with the manager and listed all the
          information needed to prepare for the health fair booth. I worked on
          the booth ideas, decided the overall mood, messages, and marketing
          materials we would bring to the booth. After the idea was approved, I:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed the backdrop</li>
          <li>
            Designed 2 standees for the left and right sides of the backdrop (as
            seen in the photo below)
          </li>
          <li>Created flyers and business cards to distribute to attendees</li>
          <li>Designed 2 hand-held hashtag signs</li>
          <li>Printed all of my designs</li>
          <li>Joined the booth setup</li>
          <li>
            Engaged and communicated with both Vietnamese and foreign attendees,
            switching between Vietnamese and English
          </li>
          <li>
            Published and updated event information on social media (Facebook,
            LinkedIn, Zalo) and responded to Facebook comments
          </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>
          This event gave me the opportunity to manage an offline marketing
          booth from concept to execution, and to apply my design and
          communication skills in a real-world, bilingual setting. Below are
          some event photos, in which I am the girl with short hair, wearing a
          grey shirt and black skirt.
