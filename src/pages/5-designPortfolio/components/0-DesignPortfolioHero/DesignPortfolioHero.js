          While Iâ€™m not a fully trained graphic designer, I completed a 6-month
          design course that gave me a solid foundation in layout, color, and
          composition. Since then, Iâ€™ve applied these skills in real marketing
          contexts â€” creating visuals that support brand identity, communicate
          clearly, and drive engagement. My design work isnâ€™t focused on visual
          trends or artistic complexity. Instead,{' '}
          <strong>
            I prioritize clarity, function, and brand consistency â€” whether itâ€™s
            a print ad, social media graphic, or promotional banner. This
            portfolio reflects how I use design as a practical marketing tool{' '}
          </strong>â€” not just to make things look good, but to help brands
          connect and perform better.
