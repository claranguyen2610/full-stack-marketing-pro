              European Eye Center is a premium ophthalmology clinic established
              in 2017, serving a multicultural patient base, including
              Vietnamese, Japanese, and English-speaking expats. As the clinic’s
              first and only in-house marketer, I redefined the marketing
              strategy, managed the entire digital ecosystem, and directly
              contributed to business growth through hands-on strategic planning
              and execution.
