            <h4>Customer-Focused & Research-Driven</h4>
            <p>
              I always start by understanding who we’re talking to. I use user
              feedback, social media insights, and competitor research to shape
              content and campaigns that actually resonate with real people —
              not just ideal personas.

          <div className="marketing-approach-item">
            <h4>Visual-First Execution</h4>
            <p>
              I’m especially drawn to UI — clean layouts, consistent branding,
              and well-designed visuals. I focus on how things look and feel to
              make them engaging and easy to navigate.

          <div className="marketing-approach-item">
            <h4>Strategy That Grows From Experience</h4>
            <p>
              I’ve learned marketing by doing — planning campaigns, managing
              websites, running ads, and learning from results. My strategies
              are shaped by data, common sense, and continuous improvement.
            </p>

          <div className="marketing-approach-item">
            <h4>Creative + Technical = My Zone</h4>
            <p>
              I design posts, build landing pages, write content, and tweak
              code. I enjoy working across design and tech to make things work
              without depending on others.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="marketing-approach-item">
            <h4>Independent & Curious</h4>
            <p>
              I’ve built websites, set up hosting, fixed SEO issues, and even
              automated reporting tools on my own. When something breaks or
              needs to be improved, I learn it and fix it.
            </p>

          <div className="marketing-approach-item">
            <h4>Growing With the Industry</h4>
            <p>
              I keep learning new tools and skills — from Meta Ads Manager to
              ReactJS. I adapt fast and genuinely enjoy exploring what’s new in
              digital marketing and tech.
